I created repository because I wrote the same code three times in a day because some companies asked me to create CRUD using Node.js, MongoDB and TDD. So I decided to create this repository to save time and help me when I need it.

## Requirements

- Node 10.16+
- NPM
- MongoDB

## Installation

Run `npm install` and copy` .env.example` to `.env`, of course you need to configure your `.env`  

## Test

To testing application just run `npm test`, all files are located in `test/` folder

## Running

### Dev

`npm run dev`

### "Prod"

`npm start`
